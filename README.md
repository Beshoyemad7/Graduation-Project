# Graduation Project  
## Autonomous Indoor Delivery Robot

---

### üß≠ Overview  
This Autonomous Indoor Delivery Robot is a self-navigating robotic platform designed to transport items autonomously within indoor environments such as offices, hospitals, and warehouses. Developed as a graduation project, it integrates **ROS (Robot Operating System)** with embedded hardware to achieve real-time mapping, localization, path planning, and obstacle avoidance.  
The robot operates without human intervention, leveraging **LiDAR-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)** and **sensor fusion** for reliable navigation. Its modular design allows for scalable deployment in various logistics scenarios, from office deliveries to healthcare supply transport.
